Workshop 01 - Setting Up and Representing Data with XML
=========================

Before starting the workshop, please go round the room and tell us:

- Your name
- Your programming experience (favoured language?)
- Your expectations of this course

Complete <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/forms/dnIkPUbdjBzzLxx23">this short survey</a> as 
part of knowing your peers better. 

This workshop will allow students to have hands-on experience of designing and exchanging data using both formats - XML, as well as setting up and getting comfortable with Python infrastructure. The experience will provide the tools that will be heavily used in the individual and group projects (e.g. development of XML DTD designs).
