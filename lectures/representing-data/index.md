Lectures - Representing Data
=================================

## XML

This lecture explores the motivation behind markup languages to represent data (the need for human- and machine-readable meta-data). Presenting XML as a solution, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of using this format, and look in-depth at the syntax and usage of XML on the web, with some practical examples of data representation.

### Readings (online)
- Anderson (2004), [Introducing XML](http://www.itwriting.com/xmlintro.php)
- Basic starter tutorial, [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp)

### Reference resources
- [XML W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/)
- Harold, Means, "XML in a Nutshell" (2004), [XML in a nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/Nutshell-Third-Elliotte-Rusty-Harold/dp/0596007647/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425359109&sr=8-1&keywords=xml+in+a+nutshell)

## JSON
Providing an alternative view-point to using XML, we look at JSON in this lecture. We will introduce the syntax and a bit of history, ahead of next week's workshop but the full utility of it will be covered in more depth in the Interactivity lectures (week 9).

### Readings
- Crockford, "Javascript: the good parts" (2008), [Javascript: the good parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425589713&sr=8-1&keywords=javascript+the+good+parts) -- Even though this is a reference book, Crockford is a very engaging writer and it is quite thin so is readable from cover-to-cover. I recommend trying to do this or dipping in to read a couple of chapters at random - if you're even just slightly interested in Javascript and JSON it is well worth it.
