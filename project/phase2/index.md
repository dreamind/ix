Introduction
------------

In 2014, Hollywood has released [more than 600 movies](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014): that is, one movie every day, plus 4 more during the weekend for you to watch. In the last decade, the way consumers access such a huge collection of movies has changed. With the proliferation of the high speed Internet, online movie rental (either via DVD or streaming) companies are killing the physical video rental shops.

Launched in 1999, [Netflix](http://netflix.com)--the largest US online movie rental then--announced its [first billionth DVD delivery](http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/26/netflix-billion-idUSN2333114720070226) in February 2007. It claimed to spend about $300 million a year on postage alone. Around 2008, Australia's [BigPond Movies](http://dvd.bigpondmovies.com/) and [QuickFlix](http://www.quickflix.com.au/) had thousands of DVDs on offer only a mouse click away. Subsequently, in 2009, [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) delivered its 2 billionth delivery in BluRay. Recently, in March 2015, [Netflix](http://netflix.com.au) officially launched its streaming service in Australia, competing with existing providers like [Stan](http//stan.com.au) and [Presto](http://www.presto.com.au).

Parallel to this trend, consumers--professional critics or moviegoers---have been sharing and exchanging information about movies online. The [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), the largest online movie database, stores information about movies, actors, directors, and any other information you can think of. There are many other similar sites that provide a comprehensive collection of reviews and critics: [metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/), [rottentomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com), [Yahoo! Movies](http://movies.yahoo.com/ ), and [movie review query engine](http://www.mrqe.com/). All of these sites allow people to collaboratively discuss and rate their favourite movies online.

One important function of these sites is to help people to select movies they like by looking at lists of movie reviews from around the world. This is a case of information filtering. [Online recommendation systems](http://readwrite.com/2007/01/16/recommendation_engines) are becoming important information filtering tools as we are overwhelmed by digital content. [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/)'s music recommendation system and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/)'s [book recommendation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167344) are such examples. These systems are very useful, not only for the audience to find their way through millions of options, but also for business to up-sell their products ([Do you want to upsize your Big Mac meal?](http://www.news.com.au/finance/mcdonalds-upsize-now-includes-a-side-order-of-tv/story-e6frfm1i-1226482216790)). It is so important that [Netflix offers USD$1,000,000](http://www.netflixprize.com/rules) to anyone who can improve their movie recommendation engine.

#### Recommender system

A 'recommender system' presents a list of items (books, movies, music) that are likely to be of interest to a user, based on what it knows about that user and the items. It makes use of intrinsic properties of the large collection of items (the content-based approach), the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach), or a combination of both. There are many ways to predict what a person would like, but there is no one correct way - as billions of dollars spent on marketing will attest to.

In a 'movie recommender' system, for example, a content-based approach may employ information such as actors, directors and/or movie genre. The combination of what the audience thinks about the movies and the audience profiles can be utilized in the collaborative filtering approach (two users with the same profile are more likely to enjoy the same movies). As people's borrowing/consuming habits get recorded, the amount of data that can be used in the system only increases.

In this assignment, you will build a simple version of such a system, which uses information about movies to find similar movies and produce recommendations.

#### Data Sets

The given data set contains information about 291 popular feature films produced from 1969 to 2008. The data set captures data such as the movie name, censorship rating, genre, director, actors, score from various critics, and worldwide gross.

<a href="assets/moviestats_med.csv" file="data"> Movie Statistic (Box Office data only)</a>

#### Part 1 - Basic Task (individual, one unique question for each person in the group)

Using spreadsheet formulas, complete the following tasks and answer all the relevant questions.

1. Present a table of actors versus genres to show the number of movies in each genre that a particular actor is featured in. Show only actors which have appeared in at least 6 movies. Colour the cells that contain these counts so that higher counts can be distinguished from lower counts. Include as the last column the total number of movies the actor is featured in. Correspondingly, include as the last row the total number of movies within each genre. Present the actor names in descending order (based on the movie count).

|&nbsp;|...|genre|...|
|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
|...|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
|actor|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
|...|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|

2. Compare the performance among movie genres based on the worldwide gross of the movies with the same genre. Ignore genres that have less than 5 movies. Visualise the comparison using appropriate chart type. Which three genres are the worst performers? Compare the performance of movie ratings (PG, G, etc) based on the same measure. Again, ignore ratings that have less than 5 movies. Visualise the comparison again. Do PG-rated movies generally earn better than R-rated movie?
3. Which three of the given reviewers in the movie data (Washington Post, Chicago Sun-Times, The New York Times, LA Weekly, Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly, Empire, Variety, Salon.com, The Onion (A.V. Club), TV Guide, Slate) are the most consistent with the 'metascore'? You can do this by calculating the average gaps between the metascore value and the score from a particular reviewer. Visualise the average gaps of all reviews to see how close they are to metascore. Consider 0 as an empty score. State your assumption when dealing with missing data.

You are not required to provide a single-cell solution, where you try to cramp all the required formulas within one cell.
Find a balance within succinctness and legibility.

#### Part 2 - Simple Recommender (group  of three)

Student groups should implement a simple movie recommendation system in Google Spreadsheet, based on the given dataset of movie attributes and reviews. The aim of the recommender is to provide a user with a list of movies that they might like. This is best done by comparing the user's query with the existing data set. You need to design a function that measures the similarity of two movies. If a user likes a particular movie, then it is most likely that he/she likes similar movies.

The next similarity score assumes that the audience generally likes movies featuring their favourite actors, as well as movies from the same director, genre, and genre.

*FavActor Similarity score*, between two movies, is defined as:

- Start with a base similarity score of 0
- For each actor that the movies share, add 3 to the similarity score
- If the two movies have the same director, add 2 to the similarity score
- If the two movies are of the same genre, add 1 to the similarity score
- Return the final similarity score
- If there is a tie, favour the newer movies.
- If there is still a tie, use the metascore to break this.

Use this *FavActor Similarity score* for your movie recommendation. User will enter the name of a movie in a cell, and your formula would automatically display a list of movies ranked by similarity scores defined above. Use exact search in finding the movie name and you are not required to support ambiguous/partial movie name query. You can include the movie entered by the user in the results.

Hints: consider using MATCH, INDEX, ARRAYFORMULA functions.

Marking Scheme
--------------

Mainly based on the correctness and the quality of your data processing and visualisation. They include:

- Assumptions and problem understanding: stated necessary assumptions if applicable, implementation is consistent with the tasks and/or assumptions
- Structure: the structure of the spreadsheet is reasonable and logical, appropriate use of named ranges
- Data processing: correct data set has been used (no missing data), efficient data processing  (no redundant computation)
- The use of formulas is clear and of reasonable length: no manual data processing (formula should be used appropriately as much as possible), robustness (the spreadsheet could be minimally adjusted to adapt to the change in the data)
- Output: produces intended results, appropriate choice of visualisation to support the intended goal

--------------

**Due Date: Friday Week 8, 5pm**:<br />
**Late penalty: 1 mark for each late day**:

Solutions to Part 1 and 2 should be provided in a single Spreadsheet document. Use one sheet for each question (you may use multiple sheets for a single question if it helps you to provide an answer systematically but name your sheet systematically, e.g. **q1_step1**, **q1_step2**, ...). While there is no limit in the number of sheets that you can create, please use a reasonable amount.

Make sure you put your student login id in the solution for the individual question, e.g **q1_step1 (ivow)**.

Name your Google Spreadsheet document using the name supplied <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b6oGh7-qas-Qw7L9kQLFypYR-ITp1Grx86hb0k9SmnA/pubhtml">here</a>.

Share your Google Spreadsheet to us. Use `Share` > `Sharing Setting`s > `Add People` command, and put down the following emails: `informatix.one@gmail.com` and the email of your tutor. Make sure you give us edit access, not only view access. Make sure you do not change the spreadsheet after deadline because we will overwrite any changes made with the last version just before the due date.
